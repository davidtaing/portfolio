title: "About Me"
---

I spent 4 years working as a Property Manager in Real Estate and I made the decision to go all-in on Software Development.

### Since July 2021, I have:
- 987 hours in VS Code and
- 2997 commits on GitHub.
- Landed a handful of Small Open Source Contributions (4 or 5, looking forward to getting more)

### And I have also been:
- Mentoring beginner programmers at Code.Sydney (a Volunteer Developer Organization)
- Posting everyday on LinkedIn
- Frequently going to Meetups

# Technologies

Currently focusing on building applications with Test-Driven Development, TypeScript, React, Next.js & Git. And I have also dabbled with Prisma, MySQL, MongoDB, Express.js. 

# That's a bit different to Property Management. So why Software Development?

That's a question that I get quite a lot.

My short answer is "it's fun!"

But for my long answer:

## I've always been a tech person.

- Built my first computer when I was 15.
- Played a ton of games (and probably should have touched more grass and talked to more people).
- And I was the unofficial IT guy at the first Real Estate.

I had been trying to learn programming for the past 8 years. It was on and off, on and off. And to be quite frank with you, I half-arsed it.

## But programming clicked for me back in July 2021.

At the end of each month, I was responsible for emailing the End-of-Month Rental Statements to our landlords. I would have to scan each statement individually, rename each PDF individually and then email each one individually.

All-in-all, this process took 5 hours each month.

I was able to build a small Node.js application which would allow me to batch send emails and have different attachments for the different owners.

With this I would have been able to reduce that time-frame to 1 hour a month.

## It was then that I understood the why.

We're solving the problems of our users.

Software engineering is just a means to that end. And one that scales.
