Have you ever wondered how a "Show Password" toggle works? I didn't know how it worked a few days ago, but now it seems so obvious. ðŸ¤£

Here's my beginner tip.

To show the password, you'll need to render the Input element as a normal Text Input. To hide the password, change the element back to a Password Input. So all you have to do is toggle between `type="text"` and `type="password"`.

## Code Example in React

<iframe
  src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/password-toggle-0uhstj?autoresize=1&fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark"
  style="width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;"
  title="Password Toggle"
  allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
  sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
></iframe>
