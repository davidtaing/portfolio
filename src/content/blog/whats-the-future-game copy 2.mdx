Tactical vs Strategic Programming is something that I have been thinking about a lot.

TL;DR

Tactical => Prioritizing short-term outcomes.

Strategic => Prioritizing longer-term outcomes. Things like robustness, scalability, each of change and more.

A few months ago, I started thinking about this.

Built a feature with assumptions baked in. A few weeks later, new requirements came in. And now my assumptions were no longer valid.

That lost me half a day.

---

❓ What can or will change in the near future? Will my assumptions hold?

💬 Company B was recently acquired, we can reasonably expect their APIs to be rebuilt.

Yes, it's something that can break my current assumptions.

Let's explore this one a bit later.

Other answers:

💬 [For] - Will we extend this feature in the future? How?

💬 [Against] - Will we be throwing this away and rebuilding this?

I think of strategic programming as buying Option contracts.

In finance, these are contracts that allow you

But you can take strategic programming too far. It's worthwhile to justify reasons for why.

---

❓ Can I justify paying for these options?

💬 Since the Company B's API was built on top of Company A's API, we will target A's data model instead of B's.

Version 2 of Company B's API probably won't release in a few months, maybe a couple of years. And even longer for B's current API to be retired.

This better positions us to migrate to B's new API when it comes out. I think it's fair to say that B's new API will somewhat be coupled to A's API.

I probably wouldn't care about the API being retired.

But what if Company B adds a new feature?

It's probably not going in the old API. This could be a good reason for us to migrate in the future.

Other answers:

💬 [For] - We're targeting a modular monolithic architecture, so we can reap the rewards of a modular codebase without paying the distributed systems tax.

Architectures evolve over time and microservices may make more sense in the future.

One of the benefits of having well defined modules is that the cut lines should be more obvious. This should make it easier for us to migrate to a microservices architecture compared to something else, like a big ball of mud monolith.

💬 [Terrible] - We're solving for 100K queries per second. But we're are currently handling 100 QPS.
