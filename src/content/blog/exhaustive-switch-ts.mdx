## Description:

Assigning the switch expression to a never-typed variable will cause a compile-time error.

## Explaination:

I like to think of types as boxes.

At the start, we have a union of the strings `"Zurich"`, `"Oslo"` and `"London"`. These are potential types inside the "location" box.

As we move down the switch statement and handle each case, we pull out these options out of the box.

And by the time we reach the default case, we would have pulled out all potential option and there's nothing inside the box. This leaves us with a `never` box

So if we forget to pull out a value out of the Locations box, we get a compile time error.

Really, really useful if you are adding more options to your union types.

**That's an introduction to Type Narrowing in TypeScript.**
