Oh damn! It's been a month.

Anyways, I've noticed that I fall into the trap of Yak Shedding a bit too much.

I've been trying to put out high quality work, but it does come at the cost of speed. Perhaps these things are still important, but I'm sure I need to better prioritize.

I think this stems from the feeling that I'm not getting the most value of my days.

Random Thoughts

- Shot a couple of DMs for startup founders, should be interesting to see what happens.
- I realized this the other day, perhaps my lack of follow through with things is because I don't track anything.
