- Had a discussion with someone regarding DSA-style questions. I haven't touched leetcode in over a year.

  Gave some advice and my main takeaway is that you can still fail an interview if all you do is "solve the problem". Really, the goal is to get to the most optimum solution and explain why.

  I dunno, I still think focusing on things like testing and logging would give more value to me and to the businesses that I work for.

- Giving scheduling a shot. We'll see how this goes.

  I'm definitely over-subscribed here, but I won't be down if I don't hit these time blocks. It's more of an "Ideal Week" calendar

- At work, lost a bit of productivity because I wasn't single tasking in the morning. I might try out putting a post it note on my monitor and only focusing on that one task.

  Wearing a cap to limit my field of view still works pretty well LOL.

To be continued. I'll merge this in for now and will get my third deep work block done.

Be back soon.

Okay back

- Watched a bit of the MySQL for Developers Course by PlanetScale. https://planetscale.com/courses/mysql-for-developers/introduction/course-introduction
- Setup the database connection on the Budgie project. I have a question regarding data validation from a HTTP request in golang (REST API). Will need to get futher visibility on this.
- As I'm learning golang, there are a few questions that pop up. I think it would be good to find a reference REST API implementation and gleam off things from it.
- As for the scheduling, the work hours were mostly correct. But I slacked a bit in after-hours deep work session. No big deal. We can always improve.
