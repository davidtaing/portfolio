### Todo.V5 - TDD Edition

Nov 2022

Technologies: TypeScript, Next.js, React, TailwindCSS, React Query, Jest, React Testing Library & Mock Service Worker.

- Worked autonomously without tutorials to build this application.
- Designed a rough REST API specification and built a Mock API using Mock Service Worker. This allowed me to develop and test my Frontend application without implementing a backend.
- Writing automated tests using Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology.
- I'm streaming my progress at <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/teeang" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">twitch.tv/teeang</a>. Here's a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1664791770" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">funny short 1 min clip.</a>

### Portfolio

Nov 2022

- Tech Stack: Astro.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS & Markdown
- I have been rebuilding this project over and over since December 2021. All of my previous versions were built using Next.js, React & TypeScript.
- For this iteration, I decided to use Astro because this project will pretty much be static. So I felt that Next.js and React would be too heavyweight.
- However Astro will allow you to use other framework's components, so that was a big selling point for me.
- Fun Fact: This is the 7th or 8th version of my portfolio!

### Email Sender

Jul 2022

- Tech Stack: TypeScript, Node, SendGrid API
- Loads data from a spreadsheet and batch sends emails using the SendGrid API allowing you to do a Mail Merge but with different attachments for different recipients.
- Fun Fact: This is the project that got me back into programming.
