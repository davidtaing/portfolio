### Todo.V5 - TDD Edition

Nov 2022

- Tech Stack: Test-Driven Development, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Jest, React Testing Library, React Query, Mock Service Worker
- I'm building this project so that I can get really good at Test-Driven Development (and Testing). I want to really understand the essence of TDD because I believe it will make a better Software Engineer.
- So far I have found that have started to think about how I should compose my components and where to locate certain behaviours.
- I'm streaming my progress at <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/teeang" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">twitch.tv/teeang</a>. Here's a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1664791770" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">funny short 1 min clip.</a>

### Portfolio

Nov 2022

- Tech Stack: Astro.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS & Markdown
- I have been rebuilding this project over and over since December 2021. All of my previous versions were built using Next.js, React & TypeScript.
- For this iteration, I decided to use Astro because I felt that it was the right choice for this project. This project will pretty much be static, so Next.js and React would be too heavyweight.
- However Astro will allow you to use other framework's components, so that was a big selling point for me.
- Fun Fact: This is the 7th or 8th version of my portfolio!

### Email Sender

Jul 2022

- Tech Stack: TypeScript, Node, SendGrid API
- Loads data from a spreadsheet and batch sends emails using the SendGrid API allowing you to do a Mail Merge but with different attachments for different recipients.
- Fun Fact: this is the project that got me back into programming.
