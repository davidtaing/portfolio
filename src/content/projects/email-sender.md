# Email Sender

## The Problem

For work, at the end of each month I was manually scaning 100 documents, renaming each scan, and manually emailing each recipient one by one. With this project, I was able to reduce this time from 5 hours to 1 hour every month.

## Description

Batch Send Emails with Individual Attachments Using the SendGrid API. Built to automate one of my work tasks as a Real Estate Agent.

## Technologies

- Node
- JavaScript
- SendGrid API

## Links

- [Github Repo](https://github.com/davidtaing/email-sender)
- [Youtube Walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0a3LBJhtfY)

## Key Points

- Loads data from a XLSX spreadsheet and batch sends emails using the SendGrid API. Think mail merge, but with the ability to specify different attachments for each recipient.
