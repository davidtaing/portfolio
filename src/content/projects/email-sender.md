# Email Sender

## The Problem

For work, at the end of each month I was manually scaning 100 documents, renaming each scan, and manually emailing each recipient one by one. With this project, I was able to reduce the time spent each month from 5 hours to 1 hour.

## Description

Loads data from a XLSX spreadsheet and batch sends emails using the SendGrid API. Think mail merge, but with the ability to specify different attachments for each recipient.

## Technologies

- Node
- JavaScript
- SendGrid API
